				<h1>Reporting Partnership Income</h1>
				<p>A partnership must file an annual information return to report the income,
				 deductions, gains, losses, etc., from its operations, but it does not pay income tax.
				 Instead, it "passes through" profits or losses to its partners.
				 Each partner reports their share of the partnership's income or loss on their personal tax return.
				 Partners are not employees and shouldn't be issued a Form W-2.
				 The partnership must furnish copies of Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to the partner. 
				 For deadlines, see About Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income.
				 Forms for Partnerships
				 The partnership, as an entity, may need to file the forms below.</p>
